  <h2>THE ANIMALS CLASS</h2>
<p>
  There is a parent class called Animal and three child classes Hawk,Rabbit,Fish and these classes inherit some attributes from there parent class but also have some exclusive attributes
</p>

<h2>THE CHARACTER CLASSES</h2>
<p>
  The parent class here is Character and the child classes are Warrior and Ninja . These child classes are inheriting the health, damage and speed from the parent class but have 2 seperate attributes called speed_multiplier and damage_resistence.
  The take damage helps us to inflict damage to a class but the base character class will be taking the whole damage but the child classes will not take the whole damage but only the amount multiplied with the damage_resistence attribute
